Notes & next steps:

- This is a minimal implementation — for production, add authentication, logging, rate-limiting, and stricter handling of PHI/PII.
- Depending on how `medgemma` expects images, you may prefer to host images on a temporary URL and pass links rather than inline base64.
- You can integrate LangChain more tightly by providing a proper `LLM` wrapper class for Ollama and using `Chains` and `Agents` to orchestrate multimodal reasoning.
