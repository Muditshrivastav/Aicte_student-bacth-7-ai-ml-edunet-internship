Notes & Next Steps

This is a minimal implementation — for production use, add authentication, logging, rate limiting, and stricter handling of PHI/PII.

Groq provides extremely fast inference, making this chatbot suitable for real-time mental health support.

LangChain can be extended further using tool calling, memory modules, or RAG pipelines if needed.
