# 🧠 Mental Health Support Chatbot

An AI-powered mental health chatbot built with LangChain, Streamlit, and Ollama that provides emotional support, wellness suggestions, and mental health resources.

## Features

✅ **Mood Analysis & Emotional Support** - Empathetic responses to your emotional state
✅ **Meditation Suggestions** - Personalized meditation techniques based on your mood
✅ **Exercise Recommendations** - Custom exercise and physical activity suggestions
✅ **Travel Suggestions** - Therapeutic travel destinations for stress relief
✅ **Conversation History** - Maintains chat history for continuity
✅ **Local LLM** - Uses Ollama for privacy-preserving offline inference
✅ **No Hardcoding** - Dynamic responses generated by AI

## Tech Stack

- **LangChain** - LLM orchestration and prompt chains
- **Streamlit** - Interactive web interface
- **OpenCV** - computer vision for live facial emotion detection
- **Groq** -  llm for fast inference
- **Python 3.8+**

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Create a Groq Account

Sign up and generate an API key from:
https://console.groq.com

### 2. Set Groq API Key

Create a .env file in the project root:

GROQ_API_KEY=your_groq_api_key_here

Or set it as an environment variable:

export GROQ_API_KEY=your_groq_api_key_here

(Windows PowerShell)

setx GROQ_API_KEY "your_groq_api_key_here"

### 3. Set Up Python Environment
### Create virtual environment
python -m venv venv

### Activate virtual environment
### Windows:
venv\Scripts\activate

### macOS/Linux:
source venv/bin/activate

### 4. Install Dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

## Running the Application

### Option 1: Direct Python Execution (Testing)

```bash
python mental_health_chatbot.py
```

This runs the chatbot in standalone mode for testing.

### Option 2: Streamlit Web UI (Recommended)

```bash
streamlit run streamlit_app.py
```

The app will be available at `http://localhost:8501`

## How It Works

### Chatbot Tab

1. User types how they are feeling

2. Input is sent to Groq LLM via LangChain

3. Model responds empathetically

4. Conversation history is preserved in session state

### Facial Emotion Detection Tab

6. User starts the camera

7. OpenCV captures live frames using cap.read()

8. Frames are analyzed by a pretrained emotion model

Dominant emotion and confidence are displayed live
## Configuration

Environment variables (optional):

GROQ_API_KEY - Groq API key

GROQ_MODEL - Groq model to use (default depends on implementation, e.g. llama3-8b-Instant)

Notes & next steps:

- This is a minimal implementation — for production, add authentication, logging, rate-limiting, and stricter handling of PHI/PII.

- Groq provides extremely fast inference, making the chatbot suitable for real-time mental health support.

- I can integrate LangChain more tightly by adding memory, tool calling, or RAG pipelines if required.
